## 🎯 **About the Project**

**Renalyze** is an AI-powered web application that **classifies kidney CT scans** as either *Normal* or *Tumor*, providing rapid and accessible diagnostic assistance to healthcare professionals and researchers.

Built with a robust deep learning pipeline using **transfer learning (VGG16)**, Renalyze integrates **modern MLOps practices** such as MLflow experiment tracking and DVC data versioning to ensure full reproducibility. Its **Flask-based web interface** offers an intuitive user experience for uploading scans and receiving instant predictions.

The application is **containerized using Docker** for consistent, scalable deployment and orchestrated to **AWS EC2 and ECR via GitHub Actions CICD pipelines**, demonstrating real-world deployment workflows used in industry.

## ✨ **Features**

* 🧠 **Deep Learning**: Transfer learning with VGG16 for kidney CT scan classification (Normal vs Tumor)
* 🔬 **Modular ML Pipeline**: Data ingestion, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction stages
* ⚙️ **MLOps Integration**: MLflow for experiment tracking, Dagshub for remote tracking, DVC for data/model versioning
* 🌐 **Web Application**: Flask-based UI for image upload and real-time predictions
* 🚀 **Deployment Ready**: Dockerized app with AWS EC2 & ECR deployment via GitHub Actions CICD
* 🔧 **Configurable & Organized**: Central YAML configs, structured logging, and clean codebase for easy customization

## ⚙️ **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamvibhav/Kidney-Disease-Classification.git
cd Kidney-Disease-Classification
````

2. **Create and activate virtual environment (conda recommended):**

```bash
conda create -n kidney python=3.9
conda activate kidney
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Initialize DVC:**

```bash
dvc init
dvc pull
```

---

## 🚀 **Usage**

### **Train the Model**

```bash
python main.py
```

Runs the full ML pipeline: data ingestion ➔ training ➔ evaluation ➔ saves best model.

### **Launch the Web App**

```bash
python app.py
```

* Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
* Upload a CT scan image and view predictions instantly.
